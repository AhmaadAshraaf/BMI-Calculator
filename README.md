# BMI-Calculator
This is a simple BMI calculator that uses the metric system to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. It's calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared.  The calculator takes your weight and height as input and outputs your BMI.
